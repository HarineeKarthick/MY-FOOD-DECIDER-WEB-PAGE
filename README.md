# MY-FOOD-DECIDER-WEB-PAGE
A VERY SIMPLE BUT USEFUL WEBPAGE FOR SOUTH INDIAN MOTHERS :)
I HAVE ATTACHED A DEMO VIDEO OF THIS WORKING PROJECT 
This is a simple web page that uses HTML,CSS and javascript as tools. This web page is used to decide which food we can prepare as a breakfast,lunch,dinner.
Actually this project contains 3 html files. index.html , breakfast.html and lunch.html. index.html is the home page. If we click "BREAKFAST" or "DINNER" button
it will redirects to "breakfast.html" file. If we click "lunch" button, it will redirect us to "lunch.html" file. In both "breakfast.html" and "lunch.html" files, I have an array of food items. When the user clicks the "START" button after choosing the category (breakfast / lunch / dinner), the javascript code present in it will generate a random number from 1 to length of fooditems array and based on that a fooditem and its corresponding image will be displayed.
see "filesss.png" image to know how all the files should be.
